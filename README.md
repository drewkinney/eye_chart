eye_chart
========

Turn a string into a dynamic eye chart.
Using PHP explode and re-assemble a string of text into a traditional Eye Chart.
The script will accept data from a variable and return to the browser a dynamically generated Eye Chart.
CSS is used to control the relative sizes of the sequential lines of the Eye Chart.
